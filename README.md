AppKeys Gnome Shell Extension
=============================

Adds Super+NUM shortcuts for activating applications from dash. No configurations necessary.
Forked from https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/413/dash-hotkeys/

Works with current Gnome Shell version 3.8 (thanks to https://github.com/acepero13)

~~Tested with 3.4 and 3.6 (3.5 should also work).~~

~~Unfortunately it is not working with current Gnome Shell version 3.8~~
